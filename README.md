# Halloapp iOS

Halloapp

## Getting Started

Open Halloapp.xcworkspace and build

### Prerequisites

iOS 13

XCode 11

CocoaPods

XMPPFramework (from HalloApp's repositories)

### Installing

CocoaPod's Pods directory is not checked in, so it must be installed

```
pods install
```
When re-installing cocoapods (when there are updates), it's safer to just remove the Pods directory and then install from scratch

## Deployment
