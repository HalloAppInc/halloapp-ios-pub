HalloApp is here! The first app for *real* relationships. And weâ€™re building it for you and your loved ones, friends and colleagues.

A completely new category. A simple, safe, and private place to connect and share what matters in your life, with the people who matter to you. In complete privacy. 

Unlike legacy social networks, HalloApp believes privacy is a fundamental human right. We use your phone number to connect you with friends and family. Beyond that, we *never* collect, store or use any personal information. 

Which means we *never* sell your personal information. Because we *never* have it.

There are no brands, ads or influencers clogging your feed. Just real people you really care about.

Your chats are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of your chats can read them, not even HalloApp.

HalloApp was founded by two ex-WhatsApp folks, who helped build WhatsApp and turn it into one of the most beloved apps in the world.

We're excited to hear from you! If you have feedback or questions, please email us at:
