HalloApp is a simple social app for sharing your everyday moments. HalloApp helps you create intimate, authentic, and private spaces with your friends and family.

HalloApp brings social networks back to basics and adds a layer of security and privacy that we think everyone in the world deserves. We use your phone number to connect you with friends and family. Beyond that, we never collect, store or use any personal information and never show you ads. 

With HalloApp, you have:
· No pressure of sending and accepting friend requests
· No ads, brands and celebrities (if you are one yourself, you’re welcomed to use HalloApp with your friends)
· A simple way to share candid moments in a relaxed environment
· An ability to create intimate, private spaces with HalloApp groups

HalloApp’s features are built around privacy, because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.

We're excited to hear from you! If you have feedback or questions, please email us at:
